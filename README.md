# Padha Nepali

This project is an interactive app where users can draw Nepali 
alphabet on a digital canvas , and a trained AI model identifies the character. It provides immediate feedback , helping users learn and practice Nepali script. The AI, trained on a comprehensive dataset ensures accurate character recognition.

Currently in this trained AI model , it recognises only one Nepali letter i.e, "Ka" -> à¤•.
You guys can trained the AI model for more alphabets and the datasets are taken from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ashokpant/devanagari-character-dataset/data).
Here, i used Keras model integrated with Tensoflow is a high-level neural networks API that allows you to build, train, and deploy various types of machine learning models, 
including Convolutional Neural Network(CNNs).
